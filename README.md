A Paste Bin-like service for **JSON** type only. All functionalities are managed via an API.


# API Documentation

## Authentication:
There are two main ways to authenticate the API routes:

 - API Key
   - Authenticated with the HTTP Header: `Authorization: Bearer {API Key}`
 - Email / Password
   - Authenticated with JSON body: `{"email": "email@example.com", "password": "mYP@ssw0rd"}`

## Content Type
Submitting `Content-Type` header in `POST` is optional and all data body will be evaluated as JSON. All responses will be in JSON format (`application/json`).
